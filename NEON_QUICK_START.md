# üöÄ Neon Database Quick Start for VideoNexus

## ‚úÖ Your Database Status

Your Neon database is **ALREADY CONNECTED** and working! Here's what you have:

- ‚úÖ Database connected
- ‚úÖ All tables created (users, channels, videos, comments, etc.)
- ‚úÖ VideoNexus schema ready
- ‚úÖ Sample data populated

## Step-by-Step Management Guide

### 1. Access Your Neon Console
1. Go to [console.neon.tech](https://console.neon.tech)
2. Sign in with your account
3. Select your VideoNexus project

### 2. Essential Database Operations

#### View Your Data
```sql
-- See all users
SELECT username, email, display_name, subscriber_count FROM users;

-- Check videos
SELECT title, view_count, like_count FROM videos ORDER BY view_count DESC;

-- Monitor channels
SELECT name, subscriber_count, video_count FROM channels;
```

#### Add New Users (for testing)
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, email, password, display_name, bio) 
VALUES ('newuser', 'user@example.com', 'password123', 'New User', 'Welcome to VideoNexus!');
```

#### Create Channels
```sql
INSERT INTO channels (user_id, name, description) 
VALUES (1, 'My Channel', 'My awesome video channel');
```

### 3. Production Management

#### Monitor Database Health
- **Storage**: Check usage in Neon console
- **Connections**: Monitor active connections
- **Performance**: Watch query execution times

#### Backup Strategy
- Neon creates automatic daily backups
- Create manual backups before major changes
- Use database branches for testing

### 4. Common Tasks

#### User Management
```sql
-- Find user by email
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = 'user@example.com';

-- Update user profile
UPDATE users SET display_name = 'New Name' WHERE id = 1;

-- Check user statistics
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_users, 
       AVG(subscriber_count) as avg_subscribers 
FROM users;
```

#### Video Analytics
```sql
-- Top performing videos
SELECT v.title, v.view_count, c.name as channel
FROM videos v 
JOIN channels c ON v.channel_id = c.id 
ORDER BY v.view_count DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Content by category
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as video_count, AVG(view_count) as avg_views
FROM videos 
GROUP BY category 
ORDER BY video_count DESC;
```
