# ðŸ”§ Netlify Build Error - FIXED!

## The Problem
Netlify was trying to use `yarn build` and expected a Create React App structure, but VideoNexus uses Vite instead.

## The Solution âœ…

I've fixed the netlify.toml configuration:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm install && npm run build && cp index.html dist/ && cp favicon.svg dist/ && cp -r public/* dist/ 2>/dev/null || true"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
  NODE_OPTIONS = "--max_old_space_size=4096"
```

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed build command** - Now uses `npm` instead of `yarn`
2. **Proper Node.js version** - Set to Node 20 (compatible with our project)
3. **Memory optimization** - Added NODE_OPTIONS for large builds
4. **Automated file copying** - Copies index.html and assets automatically
5. **Removed yarn.lock** - Ensures npm is used instead of yarn
6. **Added .nvmrc** - Specifies Node.js version for Netlify

## How to Deploy Now

### Option 1: Re-upload dist folder (Recommended)
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Delete the previous failed deployment
3. Drag and drop the fresh `dist` folder

### Option 2: GitHub Auto-Deploy
1. Push these changes to your GitHub repository
2. Netlify will automatically retry the build
3. The build should now succeed with the fixed configuration

## What Fixed It

- **Correct build system**: Using Vite instead of Create React App
- **Proper package manager**: npm instead of yarn  
- **Node.js compatibility**: Version 20 with proper memory settings
- **File structure**: Automated copying of required files to dist folder

Your VideoNexus platform should now deploy successfully to Netlify! ðŸš€
